# Challenge 04

## Description

This repo is a coding quiz designed to be dynamic in nature. It allows the developer to add an unlimited amount of questions and the code will do the rest! Currently as is, this coding quiz is comprised of 12 multiple choice questions. The quiz also includes a high scores page which is sorted by score and lists the amount of time you had remaining. The scores are stored in local storage and are able to be cleared on the high scores page.

## Usage

To begin taking the test, click on the Start Quiz button. At this point the quiz will begin and the timer will be counting down. (Note: during the quiz you are not able to view high scores until the quiz is complete and you have logged your score). If you selected the correct answer, you'll hear a ding sound indicating the answer you've chosen is correct and move on to the next question. If you select the incorrect answer, you'll hear a buzz sound indicating the answer you've chosen is incorrect. Selecting an incorrect answer will take off 10 seconds off your time, so be careful! Once you've finished answering all questions or once the time runs out you will be redirected to the Game Over screen where you can type your initials or name and see your score and time remaining. Once you hit Submit your score will be saved to local storage and is now viewable on the High Scores page by clicking on the View High Scores button.
